# __KeySpaCy__
KeySpaCy is a spaCy integration of [KeyBERT](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT) by rewriting the embedding backend. It is designed to be a component of __TRANSFORMER-BASED__ spacy pipeline, e.g, the `en_core_web_trf` pre-trained pipeline. Unlike KeyBERT, we only use pre-computed token contextualized embeddings to measure doc-substring similarities (KeyBERT compute document and keyphrase embeddings independently, resulting in recomputing overhead).
